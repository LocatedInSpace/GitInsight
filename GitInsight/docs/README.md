# Functional requirements
I've identified the following functional requirements
1. The application should be able to collect all commits with respective author names and author dates from a Git repository that resides in a local directory.
2. The application should be able to run in two modes: commit frequency mode and commit author mode. 
3. In commit frequency mode, the application should produce textual output on stdout that lists the number of commits per day. 
4. In commit author mode, the application should produce textual output on stdout that lists the number of commits per day per author.
